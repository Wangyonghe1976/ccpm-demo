# PRD: AI Assistant Note Integration

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines requirements for an integrated AI assistant system that provides real-time contextual assistance across multiple note editing formats including rich text, markdown, mind maps, and flowcharts. The system enables seamless AI collaboration during content creation with bidirectional data communication between notes and AI assistant.

## Problem Statement

Knowledge workers, students, and content creators currently face productivity challenges when switching between note-taking tools and AI assistance platforms. The context switching disrupts workflow, and AI tools often lack deep integration with specific content being created. Users need intelligent assistance that understands their current work context and can provide relevant help without breaking their creative flow.

### Key Problems Addressed
1. **Context Switching**: Users waste time moving between note editors and AI tools
2. **Lack of Context Awareness**: AI assistance doesn't understand current note content
3. **Format Fragmentation**: Different note types require different tools and workflows
4. **Conversation Discontinuity**: AI interactions are lost when switching contexts

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

#### Knowledge Worker (Sarah)
- **Goals**: Quickly capture meeting notes, organize ideas, create documentation
- **Pain Points**: Time-consuming formatting, difficulty organizing complex information
- **Needs**: Contextual assistance, multi-format support, conversation persistence

#### Student (Alex)
- **Goals**: Create study materials, understand complex concepts, organize research
- **Pain Points**: Information overload, difficulty connecting concepts
- **Needs**: Explanatory assistance, study aid generation, content organization

#### Content Creator (Maria)
- **Goals**: Generate ideas, overcome writer's block, adapt content for different platforms
- **Pain Points**: Creative blocks, maintaining consistent tone, format adaptation
- **Needs**: Idea generation, writing feedback, multi-format content creation

### User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

**As a user, I want to access AI assistance from within my note editor**
- **Given** I am editing a note
- **When** I want to get AI help
- **Then** I can open an AI assistant panel without leaving the editor
- **And** the AI can see my current note content
- **And** I can have a conversation with the AI
- **And** I can easily insert AI suggestions into my note

**As a user, I want to use different AI models for different tasks**
- **Given** I have configured multiple AI models
- **When** I need different types of assistance
- **Then** I can easily switch between models
- **And** each model maintains its own conversation context
- **And** I can set default models for different note types

**As a user, I want to work with multiple note formats seamlessly**
- **Given** I need to create different types of content
- **When** I switch between note formats
- **Then** my AI conversation context is preserved
- **And** the AI understands the specific format I'm using
- **And** I can convert content between formats with AI help

**As a user, I want my AI conversations to be saved and organized**
- **Given** I have had helpful AI interactions
- **When** I want to reference previous conversations
- **Then** I can view my conversation history
- **And** I can search through past conversations
- **And** I can export conversations for external use
