# Project Progress: AI Assistant Note Integration

## Current Status

### ðŸŸ¢ Project Initialization Complete
- CCPM system successfully initialized
- GitHub CLI installed and configured
- Project directory structure established
- CLAUDE.md created with project guidelines

### ðŸŸ¡ Context Documentation in Progress
- Project brief, vision, and overview created
- Technical context analysis underway
- System patterns and style guide pending
- Product context requirements being documented

## Recent Work

### Completed Today
1. **System Initialization**
   - Executed CCPM init script
   - Verified dependency installation
   - Established project foundation

2. **Context Creation**
   - Created project-brief.md with scope and objectives
   - Developed project-vision.md with strategic direction
   - Built project-overview.md with feature details
   - Maintained real datetime in all frontmatter

3. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Analyzed functional requirements from README
   - Identified core components needed
   - Defined integration patterns
   - Established quality attributes

## Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Complete Context Documentation**
   - Create tech-context.md with technology stack
   - Develop project-structure.md with directory layout
   - Document system-patterns.md with architecture
   - Establish project-style-guide.md with coding standards
   - Finalize product-context.md with user requirements

2. **Create PRD for AI Integration**
   - Define detailed product requirements
   - Specify user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Outline technical implementation approach
   - Establish testing strategy

3. **Begin Implementation**
   - Set up development environment
   - Create initial project structure
   - Implement core AI assistant component
   - Integrate first note editor (Rich Text)

### Medium Priority
4. **Model Management System**
   - Design model configuration interface
   - Implement local model support
   - Add API-based model integration
   - Create model switching mechanism

5. **Conversation Management**
   - Design conversation persistence
   - Implement context retention
   - Create conversation export functionality

### Future Work
6. **Additional Note Format Support**
   - Markdown editor integration
   - Mind mapping tool integration
   - Flowchart editor integration
   - Format switching capability

7. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time collaboration
   - Content analysis and suggestions
   - Automated note organization
   - Cross-format content transformation

## Current Challenges

- **Git Repository**: Project not yet initialized as git repository
- **Authentication**: GitHub CLI authentication pending
- **Dependencies**: Specific technology stack to be determined
- **Architecture**: Detailed component design in progress

## Decisions Made

1. **CCPM Adoption**: Using Claude Code PM system for project management
2. **Context-First Approach**: Creating comprehensive documentation before implementation
3. **Modular Architecture**: Designing system with separable components
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Starting with core features, adding advanced functionality later

## Upcoming Milestones

- **Milestone 1**: Complete context documentation (Today)
- **Milestone 2**: Create and approve PRD (Next session)
- **Milestone 3**: Implement AI assistant core (2 sessions)
- **Milestone 4**: Integrate first note editor (3 sessions)
- **Milestone 5**: Basic model management (4 sessions)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Well-defined requirements
- Established patterns from similar systems
- Clear user needs and expectations

### Medium Risk
- Integration complexity with multiple editor libraries
- Performance with real-time AI interactions
- State management across components

### High Risk
- Model API reliability and rate limiting
- Data synchronization across formats
- User experience consistency

## Resource Status

- **Time**: Project just started, ample time available
- **Tools**: CCPM system operational, development tools needed
- **Knowledge**: Requirements clear, implementation expertise required
- **Dependencies**: External libraries to be evaluated and integrated

## Success Indicators

- Context documentation completed and comprehensive
- PRD created with clear implementation guidance
- First working prototype within 2-3 sessions
- User testing feedback positive on core functionality
- Performance metrics meeting expectations
