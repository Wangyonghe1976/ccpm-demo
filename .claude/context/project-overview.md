# Project Overview: AI-Powered Note Creation System

## Core Features

### 1. AI Assistant Integration
- **Real-time Assistance**: AI helper available during note editing
- **Context Awareness**: Assistant understands current note content
- **Multi-format Support**: Works across all supported note types
- **Toggle Visibility**: Can be shown or hidden as needed

### 2. Note Management System
- **Rich Text Editor**: Quill-based editor for formatted content
- **Markdown Support**: Cherry editor for Markdown content
- **Mind Mapping**: SimpleMind integration for visual organization
- **Flowchart Creation**: DrawIO integration for diagrams and processes
- **Basic Operations**: Create, edit, delete, and search functionality

### 3. Model Management
- **Local Models**: Support for locally deployed AI models
- **API Integration**: Access to cloud-based AI services
- **Model Switching**: Seamless transition between different models
- **Configuration**: Easy setup and management of model endpoints

### 4. Conversation Management
- **Session Persistence**: Maintain conversation history
- **Context Retention**: Remember previous interactions
- **Thread Management**: Organize conversations by topic or note
- **Export Capability**: Save conversations for reference

### 5. Data Communication
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Real-time data exchange between notes and AI
- **Content Analysis**: AI can read and understand note content
- **Suggestions Integration**: AI recommendations can be inserted into notes
- **State Management**: Maintain consistency between UI components

## Current State

### âœ… Completed
- Project initialization with CCPM system
- Basic project structure established
- Requirements documentation created

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Context documentation creation
- Technical architecture planning
- Component interface design

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- AI assistant component implementation
- Note editor integrations
- Model management system
- Data communication layer

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations
- AI Assistant â†” Note Editors (bidirectional communication)
- Model Manager â†” AI Assistant (model provisioning)
- Conversation Manager â†” UI Components (state management)
- Note Storage â†” All Editors (persistence layer)

### External Dependencies
- Quill.js for rich text editing
- Cherry Markdown editor
- SimpleMind for mind mapping
- DrawIO for flowchart creation
- AI model APIs (OpenAI, local models, etc.)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Note Editor Wrappers**: Individual components for each editor type
- **AI Assistant Panel**: Collapsible sidebar for AI interactions
- **Model Selector**: UI for choosing and configuring AI models
- **Conversation View**: Display and management of AI dialogues

### Backend Services
- **Model Proxy**: Handles communication with AI models
- **Conversation Storage**: Persists chat histories
- **Note Management**: Handles note CRUD operations
- **Configuration Service**: Manages user preferences and settings

### Data Flow
1. User creates/edits note in specific format
2. AI assistant monitors note content changes
3. User interacts with AI assistant through chat interface
4. AI responses can be integrated back into note content
5. Conversations are persisted for future reference

## User Experience

### Primary Workflows
1. **Note Creation**: Start new note â†’ Choose format â†’ Begin editing with AI assistance
2. **AI Interaction**: Type question â†’ Get contextual response â†’ Insert suggestions
3. **Format Switching**: Change note format while maintaining content and context
4. **Model Selection**: Switch between different AI models based on needs

### Interface Elements
- Unified toolbar across all note formats
- Collapsible AI assistant panel
- Model selection dropdown
- Conversation history view
- Format switching controls

## Quality Attributes

- **Performance**: Responsive even with large notes and real-time AI interactions
- **Reliability**: No data loss during format switching or model changes
- **Security**: Secure handling of API keys and sensitive content
- **Accessibility**: Support for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new note formats or AI model providers
