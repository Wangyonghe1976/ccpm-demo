## Description
Set up the foundational React + TypeScript + Vite project configuration and development environment for the AI Assistant Note Integration feature.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React + TypeScript + Vite project initialized with proper configuration
- [ ] Basic project structure established with organized directories
- [ ] Development environment configured with necessary tooling
- [ ] Build and development scripts working properly
- [ ] TypeScript configuration optimized for the project
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier setup for code quality
- [ ] Basic README with project setup instructions

## Implementation Details

### Technical Requirements
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Vite as build tool and dev server
- Proper TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Prettier for code formatting
- Development environment setup
- Basic project structure organization

### Files to Create/Modify
- package.json (project dependencies and scripts)
- vite.config.ts (Vite configuration)
- tsconfig.json (TypeScript configuration)
- eslint.config.js (ESLint configuration)
- .prettierrc (Prettier configuration)
- index.html (main HTML entry point)
- src/main.tsx (React entry point)
- src/App.tsx (main App component)
- src/vite-env.d.ts (Vite environment types)

### Dependencies to Install
- react
- react-dom
- @types/react
- @types/react-dom
- typescript
- vite
- @vitejs/plugin-react
- eslint
- prettier
- eslint plugins for React/TypeScript

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify Vite dev server starts successfully
- [ ] Verify production build completes without errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes without type errors
- [ ] ESLint runs without critical errors
- [ ] Basic React component renders correctly

## Notes
This is a foundational task that sets up the entire project structure. All other tasks will depend on this setup being completed properly.
